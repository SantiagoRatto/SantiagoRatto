## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I appreciate your interest in my work, 1santiago.r98@gmail.com is open for mails or DM's with gchat, I usually reply within 3-5 days. In the meantime, here's some info about me:

Ever since I was small I've been fascinated with technology, science and numbers. Every now and then I would learn to code in a new language just for fun and maybe develop apps, videogames or scripts to autoperform tasks. It wasn't until a few months ago that I decided to turn what used to be hobbies and fun into my new career by certifying and expanding my knowledge with different types of courses and evaluations.

Right now I'm focusing on Data Ops: Engineering, Analysis, BI and Visualization. For this I manage a wide variety of tools such as Python, SQL Server, Microsoft Azure, Power BI and I have the skill to learn any new instrument as the need for it appears.

I'm always open to new projects, specially if they are focused on making the world a richer and better place for all.
